# How to Contribute

## Team Norms
- Be responsible - Do not slack off or free ride
- Treat one another with dignity and respect.
- Always share your work with others
- Be open-minded with all suggestions

## The git workflow

Team Greenguard employs a centralized approach.
Developers work with two copies of a repository: 
- a local copy, where changes are made
- a remote copy, where completed changes are uploaded in order to be archived and shared with others.  

The specific order is shown below:

1. Create an issue for each backlog (Tasks or Spikes)
2. Create a branch with each issue. 
    
        e.g:  34-Implement-SignIn-feature
3. Commit and push the changes.
4. Make a pull request and ask for other teammates approval
5. Squash and merge the changes to the main branch
6. Notify the teammates if there is a possibility of code collisions. 

## Detail rules of how and what to contribute
- Always notice the teammates before you work on an issue.
- Make sure to make a branch instead of directly pushing your commits to the main branch
- Make a PR before merging your branch to the main branch
- Focus on a small unit feature for every issue.
