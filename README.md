## A Short History of How the Project Came to be
  One of the major problems that we, as a species, face in the next few years is the drastic effect that climate change has on the planet. We can already see some of these effects through the record-breaking temperatures recorded globally, forest fires becoming more frequent, and the strain on our clean energy and water reserves.
  
  The team ***Greenguard*** is founded by teammates with the thought of resolving this problem. We believe that a strong social awareness and a coordinated effort are crucial to make the changes. Therefore, the team decided to make an app to tell people some unknown facts about the environment and how they could make a change.
